                            with function scope instead of block scope, i.e. it will be visible to whole function,
                            unlike other programming languages where variable is defined with block scope and is visible
                            to that block only.

                            functions/developers are using the global variable of same name then result may be
                            unexpected and can lead to hard-to-find bugs. So we always declare variables with var

            <h3 class="text-primary">Event Loop Working Process</h3>
            <p>
                JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code,
                collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. The event loop is a process that waits
                for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the
                Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are
                any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same
                process.

            <h3 class="text-primary">Get Undefined</h3>
            <p>
                A variable or an object has an undefined value when no value is assigned before using it. If we have not
                assigned any value to a variable. Then a variable lacks a value. So it is undefined.We
                will get undefined value when we call a non-existent property or method of an object. Again, a function Sum
                does not return any result but still we try to assign its resulted value to a variable. So in this case,
                result will be undefined.An undefined evaluates to false when used in conditional expression.
